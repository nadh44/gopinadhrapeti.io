                               Virtual DOM is the backbone of Reactjs as Javascript is fast but DOM is slow as updating DOM is very costly, the browser has to do lots (DOM reflow) of internal task and need to maintain state. Other Javascript framework directly manipulate the DOM when user interact with UI, which is costly and impact performance. But Reactjs solve the problem as itâ€™s a layer between user and browser DOM. Reacjs engine and Diff Algorithms take care of any UI update and use best approach to update the browser DOM. Which makes Reactjs the fastest rendering engine to render UI changes in the browser.</p>
